# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 with Deno 🦕

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) and [Deno](https://deno.com) solutions! 

## Why Deno?

Because deno is blazingly fast and the trailer launch of deno . They nailed it perfectly .
Also, I wanted to learn deno and this is a good opportunity to do so. 

Also there is a challenge going on [official Deno AoC challenge](https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024)!
